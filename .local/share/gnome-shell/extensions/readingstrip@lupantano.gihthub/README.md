# Reading Strip
Itâ€™s an **extension for Gnome-Shell**. It works as a reading guide for computer and this is really useful for people affected by **dyslexia**. 
It works great in **helping children focusing to read** very well, it marks the sentence that they are reading and hides the previous and the next one. It's already used in **education projects** at schools, it puts the attention on screen but it's also really useful for **programmers and graphic** designers who want to check their works.

**Features**:
- **horizontal strip**: function to a reading guide on the screen.
- **vertical strip**: this is really useful for graphic designers who want to check if their margins and indentations line up properly when displayed on the screen.
- **focus strip**: try it :-D;
- **strip preferences**: color, transparency, size.
- **profile**: try it :-D;
