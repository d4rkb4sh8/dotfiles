# Dotfiles Repository

This repository contains configuration files (`dotfiles`) for customizing and setting up a development environment. Dotfiles are typically used to personalize Unix-like systems, including shell configurations, editor settings, and other tools.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
```

dotfiles/
├── .config/ # Configuration files for various applications
│ ├── alacritty/ # Alacritty terminal emulator configuration
│ ├── nvim/ # Neovim configuration files
│ ├── tmux/ # Tmux configuration files
│ └── ... # Other configuration files
├── .local/ # Local user-specific configurations
│ └── bin/ # Custom scripts and binaries
├── .zshrc # Zsh shell configuration
├── .bashrc # Bash shell configuration
├── .gitconfig # Git configuration file
├── .tmux.conf # Tmux configuration file
├── README.md # Repository documentation
├── install.sh # Installation script for setting up dotfiles
└── bootstrap.sh # Script to install all required packages

````

## Key Features

- **Shell Configurations**: Includes `.zshrc` and `.bashrc` for customizing the shell environment.
- **Neovim Setup**: Configuration files for Neovim, a modern Vim-based text editor.
- **Tmux Configuration**: Custom `.tmux.conf` for managing terminal sessions.
- **Alacritty Configuration**: Settings for the Alacritty terminal emulator.
- **Custom Scripts**: Scripts located in `.local/bin/` for automating tasks.
- **Installation via GNU Stow**: Uses `stow --adopt .` to symlink dotfiles to the home directory.
- **Package Installation**: Uses `bootstrap.sh` to install all required packages.

## Installation

To install these dotfiles and all required packages on your system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d4rkb4sh8/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
````

2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dotfiles
   ```
3. Use GNU Stow to symlink the dotfiles to your home directory:

   ```bash
   stow --adopt .
   ```

   The `--adopt` flag allows Stow to adopt any existing files in the target directory, merging them with the dotfiles in the repository.

4. Install all required packages in Debian using the `bootstrap.sh` script:

   ```bash
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ```

   This script will install the necessary packages and dependencies for the configurations in this repository.

5. Verify the installation by checking that the dotfiles are correctly linked and all packages are installed.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the configurations to suit your preferences. For example:

- Edit `.bash_aliases` to add custom aliases or environment variables.
- Update `.config/nvim/` to customize your Neovim setup.
